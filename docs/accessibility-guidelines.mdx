# Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility requirements and best practices for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course book.

## Alt Text Requirements

All images must include descriptive alt text that serves the following purposes:

1. **Descriptive Context**: Alt text should describe the content and function of the image for users who cannot see it.
2. **Educational Value**: For diagrams, charts, and technical illustrations, include key information that would be gained from viewing the image.
3. **Technical Details**: For robot photos, specify the model, key features, and any relevant specifications.

### Alt Text Examples

**Good Examples:**
- `![ROS 2 architecture diagram showing nodes, topics, and services communication patterns](img/ros2-architecture.png)`
- `![Atlas robot from Boston Dynamics performing a backflip with labeled joints and actuators](img/atlas-robot-backflip.png)`
- `![Gazebo simulation environment with humanoid robot navigating through obstacle course](img/gazebo-simulation.png)`

**Avoid:**
- `![Robot](img/robot.png)` - Too vague
- `![Diagram](img/diagram.png)` - Not descriptive
- Empty alt text for informative images: `![](img/image.png)` - Only acceptable for decorative images

## WCAG Compliance

Our course book aims to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

- **Color Contrast**: All text must have sufficient contrast against its background (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be accessible via keyboard
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H6) and semantic elements
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: All content must be accessible to screen readers

## Technical Implementation

### Code Syntax Highlighting
- Python and ROS2 code snippets have syntax highlighting enabled
- Code blocks include proper language identifiers (```python, ```bash, ```cpp)

### Diagrams and Visual Content
- Mermaid diagrams are accessible through proper alt text and descriptions
- Complex diagrams should include detailed captions explaining key elements

### Interactive Elements
- Markdown checkbox quizzes are keyboard accessible
- All buttons and links have proper ARIA labels
- Form elements have associated labels

## Content Guidelines

### Headings Structure
- Each page should have one H1 (the page title)
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H2 → H3 → H4)
- Headings should be descriptive and hierarchical

### Link Text
- Use descriptive link text instead of generic "click here"
- Links should make sense out of context
- External links should be clearly identified

### Media Accessibility
- Videos should have captions and transcripts
- Audio content should have transcripts
- Interactive elements should have text alternatives
