# Performance Monitoring with Lighthouse

This document outlines the Lighthouse performance monitoring setup for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course book.

## Performance Targets

Our site aims to maintain high performance standards with the following targets:

- **Performance Score**: ≥ 90
- **Accessibility Score**: ≥ 90
- **Best Practices Score**: ≥ 90
- **SEO Score**: ≥ 90

### Core Web Vitals Targets

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: ≤ 1.5 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: ≤ 2.5 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: ≤ 0.1
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: ≤ 200ms
- **Speed Index**: ≤ 3 seconds

## Running Performance Audits

### Local Audits

To run a Lighthouse audit locally:

```bash
npm run audit
```

This command will build the site and run Lighthouse audits against it.

### Build + Audit

To build the site and run audits in one command:

```bash
npm run audit:build
```

### Manual Lighthouse Testing

You can also run audits manually using the Chrome DevTools Lighthouse panel or the command line:

```bash
npx @lhci/cli autorun
```

## Configuration

The Lighthouse configuration is defined in `lighthouserc.json` and includes:

- Performance budgets with minimum scores
- Assertion rules for specific metrics
- Multiple runs for consistent results
- Desktop preset for consistent testing

## Continuous Monitoring

Performance monitoring is integrated into the development workflow to ensure:

- Performance regressions are caught early
- All PRs meet performance standards before merging
- Consistent user experience across all devices

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

To maintain high performance scores:

1. **Optimize Images**: Use WebP format where possible and compress images
2. **Minimize JavaScript**: Reduce bundle sizes and eliminate unused code
3. **Efficient CSS**: Avoid CSS bloat and use efficient selectors
4. **Resource Loading**: Implement proper loading strategies for assets
5. **Caching**: Use proper caching headers for static resources

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

If Lighthouse scores fall below targets:

1. Check the audit report for specific recommendations
2. Focus on opportunities with highest potential savings
3. Review recent changes that may have impacted performance
4. Test on different network conditions and devices
