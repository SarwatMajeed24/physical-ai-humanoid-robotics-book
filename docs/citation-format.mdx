# IEEE Citation Format Guide

This document outlines the IEEE-style citation format to be used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course book.

## IEEE Citation Style

All references in the course book must follow the IEEE citation style. Citations should be numbered sequentially in the order they appear in the text and formatted as follows:

### In-Text Citations

Use numbered citations in square brackets, like this: [1], [2], or multiple citations [1], [3], [5]. For multiple citations, list them in ascending order with commas separating them.

### Reference List Format

References should appear at the end of each chapter or document in the following format:

```
[1] A. Author, B. Author, and C. Author, "Title of paper," Journal Name, vol. X, no. Y, pp. XX-XX, Year.
```

## Component Usage

Use the `Citation` component to create properly formatted IEEE citations:

```md
import { Citation } from '@site/src/components/EducationalComponents';

<Citation
  id={1}
  authors={["A. Author", "B. Author"]}
  title="Title of the Paper"
  journal="Journal Name"
  year="Year"
  volume="X"
  issue="Y"
  pages="XX-XX"
  doi="10.xxxx/xxxxx"
  link="https://example.com"
/>
```

### Required Fields

- `id`: Sequential number for the citation (required)
- `authors`: Array of author names or string (required)
- `title`: Title of the paper, article, or book (required)
- `journal`: Name of the journal, conference, or book (required)
- `year`: Publication year (required)

### Optional Fields

- `volume`: Volume number for journal articles
- `issue`: Issue number for journal articles
- `pages`: Page range (e.g., "123-130")
- `doi`: Digital Object Identifier
- `link`: URL to the source (creates an [Online] link)

## Examples

### Journal Article

[1] A. B. Smith, C. D. Jones, and E. F. Garcia, "A study on humanoid robotics," IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 827-840, 2019.

### Conference Paper

[2] J. Doe and A. Smith, "Advances in physical AI," in Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 1234-1240, 2022.

### Book

[3] A. Author, B. Author, and C. Author, *Title of Book*. City, Country: Publisher, Year.

## Best Practices

- Always verify the accuracy of citation information
- Use the most authoritative version of a publication when multiple versions exist
- Include DOIs when available for journal articles
- For online sources, include the access date if the content may change over time
- Cite primary sources whenever possible rather than secondary sources
